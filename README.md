# A Template Repository


Use this template to [create a repository] with the default initial files for a Github repository, including:

- The correct LICENSE
- Github Action example
- A .gitignore file
- A CODEOWNERS file
- A dependabot.yml file

Once you have created your repository, please:

- Edit the copy of this README.md file to document your project.
- Grant permission/s to the appropriate team/s with at least one team having Admin permissions.
- Try not to add individual users to the repository, instead use a team.
- Ensure branch protection is set up on the main branch.
- [Optional] Modify the CODEOWNERS file and state the team or users that can authorise PR's.
- Modify the Dependabot file to suit the [dependency manager](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#package-ecosystem) you plan to use and for [automated pull requests for package updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/enabling-and-disabling-dependabot-version-updates#enabling-dependabot-version-updates). Dependabot is enabled in the settings by default.
- Modify the short description found on the right side of the README.md file.
- For a private repo with no GitHub Advanced Security license remove the .github/workflows/dependency-review.yml file.
